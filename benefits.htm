					<h3>About Cost</h3>
					<p><font size="4">Chandrayaan 2 mission by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is one of the most eagerly- awaited events in the history of the Indian space programme. Even as the Chandrayaan 2 launch faced an unexpected delay due to ‘technical glitch’, the space-agency has been leaving no stone unturned in making this mission a historic one. Chandrayaan 2 launch, which was earlier scheduled on July 15,
					will now take place on July 22 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota.</font></p>

<h3>Benefits of Chandrayan 2</h3>
<p><font size="4">If Chandrayaan 2 launch as well as the mission become successful, ISRO will become the first space agency to conduct a soft landing on the south polar region of Moon. Chandrayaan 2 mission is also the first expedition by the Indian space-agency to attempt a soft landing on the lunar surface with home-grown technology. Chandrayaan 2 is also the first Indian mission to explore the lunar terrain with home-grown technology. If Chandrayaan 2 mission becomes successful,
 India will become the fourth country ever to soft-land on the lunar surface.</font><br/><br/>
