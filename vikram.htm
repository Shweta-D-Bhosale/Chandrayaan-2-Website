					<h3>Radio Anatomy of Moon Bound Hypersensitive ionosphere and Atmosphere (RAMBHA)</h3>
					<p><font size="4">The lunar ionosphere is a highly dynamic plasma environment. Langmuir probes, such as RAMBHA, have proven to be an effective diagnostic tool to gain information in such conditions. Its primary objective is to measure factors such as:<br><br>
o	Ambient electron density/temperature near the lunar surface<br><br>
o	Temporal evolution of lunar plasma density for the first time near the surface under varying solar conditions

<h3>Chandra's Surface Thermo-physical Experiment (ChaSTE)</h3>
<p><font size="4">ChaSTE measures the vertical temperature gradient and thermal conductivity of the lunar surface. It consists of a thermal probe (sensors and a heater) that is inserted into the lunar regolith down to a depth of ~10 cm. ChaSTE operates in two modes:
o	Passive mode operation in which continuous in-situ measurements of temperature at different depths are carried out
o	Active mode operation in which temperature variations in a set period of time, and the regolith's thermal conductivity under contact, are estimated

<h3>Chandra's Surface Thermo-physical Experiment (ChaSTE)</h3>
<p><font size="4">ILSA is a triple axis, MEMS-based seismometer that can detect minute ground displacement, velocity, or acceleration caused by lunar quakes. Its primary objective is to characterise the seismicity around the landing site. ILSA has been designed to 
identify acceleration as low as 100 ng /√Hz with a dynamic range of ±0.5 g and a bandwidth of 40 Hz. 
The dynamic range is met by using two sensors — a coarse-range sensor and a fine-range sensor.</font></p>
