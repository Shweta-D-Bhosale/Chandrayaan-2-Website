					<h3>Launching of Chandrayaan 2</h3>
					<p><font size="4">Chandrayaan-2 launch was initially scheduled for 14 July 2019, 21:21 UTC (15 July 2019 at 02:51 IST local time).[20] However, the launch was aborted 56 minutes and 24 seconds before launch due to a technical glitch, so it was rescheduled to 22 July 2019.[46][8] Unconfirmed reports later cited a leak in the nipple joint of a helium gas bottle as the cause of cancellation.[47][117][118]
Finally Chandrayaan-2 was launched on-board the GSLV MK III M1 launch vehicle on 22 July 2019 at 09:13 UTC (14:43 IST) with better-than-expected apogee as a result of the cryogenic upper stage being burned to depletion, which later eliminated the need for one of the apogee-raising burns during the geocentric phase of mission.[48][119][120] This also resulted in the saving of around 40 kg fuel onboard the spacecraft.[121]
Immediately after launch, multiple observations of a slow-moving bright object over Australia were made, which could be related to upper stage venting of residual LOX/LH2 propellant after the main burn.

<h3>Geocentric phase</h3>
<p><font size="4">After being placed into a 45,475 × 169 km parking orbit by the launch vehicle,[48] the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft stack gradually raised its orbit using on-board propulsion over 22 days. In this phase, one perigee-raising and 
five apogee-raising burns were performed to reach a highly eccentric orbit of 142,975 × 276 km[104] followed by trans-lunar injection on 13 August 2019.[105] Such long Earth-bound phase with multiple orbit-raising manoeuvres exploiting the Oberth effect was required because of the 
limited lifting capacity of the launch vehicle and thrust of the spacecraft's on-board propulsion system. A similar strategy was used for 
Chandrayaan-1 and the Mars Orbiter Mission during their Earth-bound phase trajectory.[124] On 3 August 2019, the first set of Earth images were captured by the LI4 camera on the Vikram lander, 
showing North American landmass.</font><br/><br/>

<h3>Selenocentric phase</h3>
<p><font size="4">After 29 days from its launch, the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft stack entered 
lunar orbit on 20 August 2019 after performing a lunar orbit insertion burn for 28 minutes 57 seconds. 
The three-spacecraft stack was placed into an elliptical orbit that passes over the polar regions of 
the Moon, with 18,072 km (11,229 mi) aposelene and 114 km (71 mi) periselene.[106] By 1 September 2019 this elliptical orbit was made nearly circular with 127 km (79 mi) aposelene and 119 km (74 mi) periselene after four orbit-lowering maneuvers[107][108][109][110] followed by separation of Vikram lander from the orbiter on 7:45 UTC,
 2 September 2019.[111]</font>
